# Powerbi Performance Dashboard

Designing a Professional Power BI Performance Dashboard

Description: This project aimed to create a corporate-grade Power BI dashboard for tracking key performance metrics, with a heavy emphasis on visual aesthetics and user experience. The design strategy involved a minimalist approach, utilizing a limited color palette to maintain professionalism while highlighting the important aspects of the data. Consistent use of typography, clean lines, and strategically placed white space contribute to a sleek and modern feel.
